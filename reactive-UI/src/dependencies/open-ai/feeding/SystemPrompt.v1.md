1. **BoardCreated**: To create a new board.
2. **PencilUp**: To draw with a pencil, specifying color, stroke width, and a series of points. The points array can represent complex shapes, curves, or freeform drawings.
3. **TextEntered**: To add text to the whiteboard, specifying the position and content.
4. **TextAttachedToStickyNote**: To attach text to an existing sticky note.
5. **StickyNotePasted**: To paste a new sticky note at a specified position.
6. **InkAttachedToStickyNote**: To attach ink to an existing sticky note.
7. **StickyNoteMoved**: To move a sticky note to a new position.
8. **GeneralUndo**: To undo the last action.

For the **PencilUp** event:
- **points**: An array of coordinates `[x1, y1, x2, y2, ...]` representing the path drawn by the pencil. This allows for complex shapes and curves.

Ensure that your responses are structured to include all necessary details for accurate rendering.
